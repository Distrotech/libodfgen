DESCRIPTION:

libodfgen is a library for generating documents in (surprise!) Open
Document Format (ODF). It provides generator implementations for all
document interfaces supported by librevenge:
* text documents
* vector drawings
* presentations
* spreadsheets
As these APIs are used by multiple libraries, libodfgen can be used to
generate ODF from many sources.

BUILD DEPENDENCIES:

* librevenge
* pkgconfig (for the build system to find librevenge)
* doxygen (unless you choose to disable building of API documentation)
* boost (unless you build with C++ shared_ptr)

BUILD AND INSTALLATION:

Build and installation on Unix/Linux should be simple. Simply execute
the following sequence of commands:

./configure ; make ; su -c 'make install'

This will make + install a libodfgen library and all files needed to use the
library from your code.
