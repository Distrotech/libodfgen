DESCRIPTION:

libodfgen is a library for generating documents in (surprise!) Open
Document Format (ODF). It provides generator implementation for the
following libraries:
* libwpd (::WPXDocumentInterface): text documents
* libwpg (libwpg::WPGPaintInterface): vector drawings
* libetonyek (libetonyek::KEYPresentationInterface): presentations
As these APIs are used by multiple libraries, libodfgen can be used to
generate ODF from many sources.

INSTALLATION:

Installation on Unix/Linux should be simple. Simply execute the following 
sequence of commands:

./configure ; make ; su -c 'make install'

Note that this assumes that you have development versions of libwpd (>= 0.9.0),
libwpg (>= 0.2.0) installed. Eventually you should have boost headers if you
choose to compile using boost smart pointers.

You will also need to have pkgconfig installed, for the build system to find
both libwpd and libwpg, and doxygen, unless you choose to disable building
of API documentation.

This will make + install a libodfgen library and all files needed to use the
library from your code.
